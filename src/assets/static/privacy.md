### 5 How we share the information we collect

We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

#### With your consent

We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, you may direct us through your actions on Blockwatch to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.

#### With service providers

We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While Blockwatch processes all User Personal Information in the United States and the European Union, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our service providers are, please see a list of Subprocessors below:

| Name of Subprocessor  | Description of Processing         | Location of Processing |

| Stripe				| Payment provider 					| United States |

When we bring on a new subprocessor who handles our Users' Personal Information, or remove a subprocessor, or we change how we use a subprocessor, we will update this page.

#### For security purposes

If you are a member of an Organization, Blockwatch may share your username, Usage Information, and Device Information associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization who has agreed to the Corporate Terms of Service or applicable customer agreements, to the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

#### For legal disclosure

Blockwatch strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. Blockwatch may disclose User Personal Information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

#### Change in control or sale

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.

#### Aggregate, non-personally identifying information

We share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Blockwatch, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the open source activity around Blockwatch products.

We **do not** sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.

Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, when it goes into effect we will voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to all of our users in the United States, not just those who live in California.


### 6 How Long Your Information is Retained

We retain your personal information for as long as you have an active account, as needed to provide you with data, to comply with our legal and regulatory processes and to enforce this Privacy Policy. Blockwatch has established internal policies for the deletion of personal information from client accounts following termination of a client’s subscription to the data product. After you close your account, we delete your personal information and only retain data in a form such that it does not identify you personally.

Site activity and analytics data, including analytics data collected by third parties who function as our data processing agents, is retained for 180 days and automatically deleted after this time period.


### 7 How Your Information is Protected

You are responsible for creating this password and for protecting it and not sharing it with any third party. Blockwatch takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
